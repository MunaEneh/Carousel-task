            The Colosseum, Rome
            <p>
              The most famous and largest structure still standing from the
              Roman Empire, the Colosseum is also the biggest attraction of
              modern-day Rome. It's been a bucket-list destination of travelers
              for generations. And it does not disappoint. Much of the
              attraction comes from its location, high in the jungle-clad
              mountains of Peru. Set on a high plateau with soaring green
              mountains, the setting is surreal. The sheer tenacity of the
              original builders to create this amazing place in what would have
              been impenetrable jungle, is, in itself, impressive.

              If you are planning to see only one attraction in South America,
              this is the place to come. The ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu
              is arguably the most impressive ruined city in the world.

            The Acropolis, Athens
            <p>
              Perched above present day Athens, the Acropolis draws you up and
              in. Follow in the footsteps of ancients as you walk up the same
              steps that have been walked on since 438 BC - 2,500 years.Views
              out over the city are incredible as you walk between the
              meticulously restored ancient buildings. Near the end of the day,
              you'll want to linger and watch the sunset from the stairs near
              the entrance. This is a nightly ritual in Athens.

              Set in a steamy jungle with three volcanoes providing the

              Borobudur dates from the 9th century and is one of the largest
              Buddhist temples in the world. It's a fascinating place to wander
              about. Over 500 Buddhas are spread around the site, some of which
              sit under ornate stupas.
